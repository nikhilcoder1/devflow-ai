# DevFlow AI - Project Summary

## Overview

DevFlow AI is a full-stack AI-powered developer Q&A platform inspired by StackOverflow, built with modern SaaS architecture principles.

Unlike traditional forums, DevFlow enhances discussions with AI-assisted answers, duplicate detection, and intelligent tagging.

This project was built as a production-ready SaaS MVP, not just a tutorial clone.
